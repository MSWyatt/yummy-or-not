 The mobile half of my Yummy-Or-Not project.
 
 This android app opens the camera, takes a picture, and uploads it to a Google Datastore. 
 In this case, to the yummy-or-not datastore. That's currently hard-coded in, but making 
 that easier to modify should go on the to-do list for me.

 This is set up so that you can just download the files and roll. If you just want the "guts"
 of the project, it's in Android/src/com/androidproject/MainActivity.java
