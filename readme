My yummy-or-not project, probably the most difficult program I made for my degree.

The project comes in two halves: a web half which runs off Google Datastore, and
an Android app, which takes pictures and uploads them directly to the Datastore.

Neither half is hugely optimized (that's on the to-do list, I swear!), but everything
here should work straight out of the box (well, aside from needing a Google Datastore).
